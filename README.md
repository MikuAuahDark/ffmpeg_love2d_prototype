FFmpeg under LOVE2D
===================
This is proof-of-concept that it's possible to use FFmpeg library to add support of
playing videos in LOVE2D other than Theora (`love.graphics.newVideo`).

You need FFmpeg v3.2 (possibly doesn't run under Linux) with it's DLLs installed and available in `%PATH%` and LOVE2D 0.10.0
